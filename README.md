# Downtown Chronicles 2

## Overview
**Downtown Chronicles 2** is a city-based roleplaying game developed on the Roblox platform. Originally created and worked on throughout much of 2024, the game was designed to provide an immersive urban roleplaying game experience with various features, locations, and roleplay mechanics. However, due to other life commitments, development was paused, leaving many features unfinished.

Rather than let the project go to waste, the codebase has been made open-source to allow others to contribute, expand, and carry on its legacy.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Roblox Studio**: Required for development.
- **Rojo (optional but recommended)**: For local development and version control integration.
